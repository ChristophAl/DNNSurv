This is the R code for the paper "DNNSurv: Deep Neural Networks for Survival Analysis Using Pseudo Values"
The getPseudoConditional function is the first step to obtain pseudo conditional survival probabilities and then these probabilities are used as a continuous response variable in standard neural network models
